## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you detect a vulnerability in the project, please reach me by email at raul[at]piraces.dev.

I will prioritize the solving of the vulnerability, expect updates in some days.

This is an Open Source Project, if the vulnerability is accepted it will be fixed and I will appreciate it very much, but I can't do nothing more than that :cry:
